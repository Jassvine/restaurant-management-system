# restaurant-management-system
Malaysians love for food has made the Food and Beverage sector a fast growing
and broad sector here in our country. Our country consists of many different cultures
which has resulted in many different cuisines that adapt to different cultural
adaptations and even mixed cultures. The Malaysian chain of food outlets is even
home to traditional food and beverages even outside of our country.
These days there are many restaurants around to cater for peopleâ€™s different taste
buds. This promotes heavy competition between these restaurant owners and it is
crucial for them to manage the restaurant systematically.
And as for the customers itself, going through the process of queuing up for a
table, navigating through a menu as well as waiting for the food to be ready can be
pretty time consuming and frustrating.
However thankfully in our modern world we are able to overcome this problem
by means of a simple restaurant management system. The main objective is to cater
for the convenience of the customers as well as organized management for the
restaurant itself such as improvement of receiving and taking orders and so on.
This management system will consist of a log in module and a registration
module, a module to list down menus as well as store orders as well as billing
modules. This is a cost efficient way of managing a restaurant system digitally whilst
also providing quality services to customers.
